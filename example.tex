Some epic proposal title
}
\end{center}


Say you're about to write some epic observing proposal. Or anything else where you have a strict page limit, which is why you use two-column format by default.

Say you want the reader to see that you have done awesome stuff, so you cite everything with author names \citep{Poppenhaeger2013}.

This will use quite some space in the proposal text, which means you want to save space in the references section. So I've made a bibliography style file (bibshort.bst) and a python script (TibyBib.py) to hack the output from that file in order to get a really small references section.

So, let's cite some more stuff and see what it looks like: \cite{Guenther2012, Robrade2012, Albrecht2012}. 

\bigskip

We run \verb+pdflatex+ (or \verb+latex+):

\bigskip

\verb+pdflatex example+

\bigskip

then \verb+bibtex+:

\bigskip

\verb+bibtex example+

\bigskip

and then we run the python script:

\bigskip
\verb+python bib_tiny.py example.bbl+

\bigskip

Then we re-run \verb+pdflatex+/\verb+latex+ twice to get the references correct:

\verb+pdflatex example+

And then the tiny references section looks like this:

\begin{footnotesize}

\bibliographystyle{bibshort}
\bibliography{mybib.bib}

\end{footnotesize}
